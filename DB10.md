1. The first thing to do is to decide what kind of filesystem is going to be created.
   + Here I've created an extended filesystem version 4.

    ```sh
    mkfs.ext4  /dev/sda1
    ```

1. The next thing to do is to mount the filesystem in your OS.

    ```sh
    mkdir /mnt/mnt_sda1
    ls /mnt_sda1
    mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1
    df -h
    ```

1. Next edit the the `/etc/fstab` file to include your mount information

   ```sh
   UUID=fe9be78a-30e6-4c16-b703-1825073c9e83 /mnt/mnt_sda1/ ext4 defaults 0 0
   ```

1. Then you umount it.

   ```sh
   umount /mnt/mnt_sda1/
   mount -a
   df -h
   ```

1. Check mount location

   ```sh
   mount | grep ^/dev/sd
   ```
